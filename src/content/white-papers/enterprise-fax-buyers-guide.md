This guide helps IT leaders and procurement teams navigate the complex landscape of enterprise fax solutions.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Market Overview**: Understanding the current fax technology landscape
2. **Deployment Models**: On-premise, cloud, and hybrid—when to use each

## Key Considerations

### Compliance Requirements
Different industries have different requirements. Healthcare organizations must ensure HIPAA compliance, while financial services may need PCI DSS and SOC 2 certifications.

### Integration Needs
Consider your existing systems: EHR/EMR, ERP, CRM, document management. The right fax solution should integrate seamlessly, not create new silos.

### Volume and Scale
Understand your current and projected fax volumes. Some solutions charge per page, others per user, and pricing models vary dramatically.

### Support and SLAs
Enterprise fax is often mission-critical. Evaluate vendor support capabilities, response time guarantees, and escalation procedures.
