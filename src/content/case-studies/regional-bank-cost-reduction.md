title: "How a Regional Bank Reduced Fax Costs by 60%"
description: "A mid-sized regional bank was spending over $80,000 per month on legacy fax infrastructure. We migrated them to a hybrid cloud solution that cut costs while improving reliability."
industry: "Financial Services"
challenge: "The bank's RightFax servers were aging, maintenance costs were escalating, and the IT team was spending 20+ hours per week managing fax-related issues. Compliance requirements made a pure cloud migration risky."
solution: "We designed a phased hybrid migration: critical high-security fax lines remained on modernized on-premise infrastructure, while general business faxing moved to etherFAX cloud. Custom routing rules ensured compliance."
results:
  - "60% reduction in monthly fax infrastructure costs"
  - "95% decrease in IT support tickets related to faxing"
  - "Zero compliance violations during or after migration"
  - "99.99% uptime achieved (up from 97.2%)"

## The Challenge

First National Regional Bank had been running the same RightFax infrastructure for over a decade. While it worked, the costs were becoming unsustainable:

- **Hardware maintenance**: $15,000/month for aging servers
- **Phone lines**: 200+ analog lines at $40/month each
- **Staff time**: Two full-time employees managing fax issues
- **Downtime**: Average of 4 hours per month of unplanned outages

The bank's compliance team was nervous about cloud solutions, citing concerns about data residency and regulatory requirements. But the status quo wasn't sustainable.

## Our Approach

After a comprehensive audit of their fax traffic, we discovered that:

- 70% of faxes were standard business documents (invoices, statements)
- 20% were customer-facing documents requiring encryption
- 10% were highly sensitive internal documents

This insight drove our hybrid strategy:

### Phase 1: Cloud Migration (Months 1-2)
We moved standard business faxing to etherFAX cloud, which immediately eliminated 140 phone lines and reduced hardware requirements.

### Phase 2: On-Premise Modernization (Month 3)
We upgraded the remaining on-premise infrastructure to a modern, containerized RightFax deployment with proper high-availability.

### Phase 3: Integration & Optimization (Month 4)
We implemented intelligent routing rules and connected both systems to the bank's document management platform.

## The Results

Six months after completion:

- Monthly costs dropped from $82,000 to $33,000
- IT tickets related to faxing dropped from 50/week to under 3
- The compliance team was satisfied with the security posture
- Staff could focus on strategic initiatives instead of fax maintenance

## Key Takeaways

1. **Don't force all-or-nothing migrations**: Hybrid approaches often deliver the best ROI
2. **Audit before acting**: Understanding traffic patterns drove our strategy
3. **Compliance doesn't mean "no cloud"**: Modern cloud fax solutions can meet strict requirements
